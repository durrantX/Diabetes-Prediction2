# Business and Data Understanding

## Problem Statement
In the United States, 1 in 3 adults are prediabetic, and an alarming 8 out of 10 individuals remain unaware of their condition. Without timely intervention, most prediabetic individuals are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition within 5 years. Diabetes is associated with severe health complications and financial burdens. According to the CDC 1 in 4 health care dollars is spent on people with diagnosed diabetes. In 2022 the USA spent $413 billion for diabetic care.  

The town of Hanover is taking a proactive, holistic approach to address this crucial health challenge by implementing a Diabetes Education and Engagement Program (DEEP). The initiative leverages data analysis to highlight the most at-risk patients so that they may be targeted for earlier healthcare intervention slowing the onset and progression of the disease. Additionally, the project seeks to improve early detection, provide targeted interventions, and empower individuals through education and engagement to prevent the progression of diabetes.

## Data Understanding 
The Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset data was sourced from Kaggle  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset and contains healthcare statistics and lifestyle information of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_012 has 3 classes. 
- 0 : no diabetes or only during pregnancy.
- 1 : prediabetes.
- 2 : diabetes.

This dataset has 21 feature variables. Features are described clearly with variable explanation available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators and https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/pdf/2015_calculated_variables_version4.pdf

* AUC Score

# Summary 

A diabetes status classification system was developed using the CDC BRFSS2015 dataset, which contains 253,680 entries across 22 columns. Initial data exploration highlighted a significant class imbalance in the Diabetes_012 variable. To address this imbalance, resampling methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) were applied.
To tackle the problem of risk assessment and prediction of at-risk and diabetic groups, a logistic regression baseline model was built and compared to ensemble models, including Random Forest and XGBoost . Hyperparameter tuning was conducted on the selected XGBoost using ParamGridBuilder to optimize model performance. The final model's precision score improved to 59%, compared to a baseline of 56%.

The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework was employed to enhance the model's interpretability. SHAP fidelity was evaluated by comparing the model's predictions to SHAP predictions across the full dataset and a subset of 100 samples. The mean absolute error for SHAP fidelity was close to 0, demonstrating that the SHAP explanations were highly faithful to the model's predictions. Additionally, SHAP was used to analyze feature importance and explore feature interactions through dependence plots, providing further insights into the relationships between key predictors.

# Preprocessing
 ## Prepare data for modeling
- Feature engineer composite scores
- Create training and testing sets
- Define the predictor and target variables
- Perform a standard train-test split.
- Assign 20% to the test set
- Set random_state ensuring that the split is reproducible

Description: 
- Both Diabetes and Pre-Diabetes are grouped into one category (Diabetes) indicating blood glucose conditions, with Non-Diabetes as the second category.
- Early Detection Focus: This grouping could be useful if the primary goal is to flag anyone at risk of diabetes, including those in the pre-diabetic stage.
- Preventive Action: This approach supports early intervention because it treats both diabetic and pre-diabetic as high-risk groups, prompting similar preventive measures.

**Feature engineer composite scores**

**Healthy eating score**
The healthy eating score provides insights of the dietary behavior of individuals. 

**Lifestyle score = (HvyAlcoholConsump + Smoker + 'PhysActivity )**
The Lifestyle Score  feature will help to capture holistic view of an individualâ€™s lifestyle  and the relationship to the  health outcome. The lower score indicates a healther lifestyle

**Comorbiditity rating= HighBP HighChol	BMI(Obese) HeartDietseaseorAttack Stroke Age**
The Comorbidity Rating will provide a  comprehensive method  to quantify the impact of multiple health conditions on  diabestes risk assesment and prediction . The **lower score** indicates a lower risk of diabetes and prediabetes

**Healthcare Access and Engagement Score**
Healthcare Access and Engagement Score composite variable will provide a broader perspective on an individualâ€™s access to and ability to afford healthcare as well as utilization. Higher score means more access and greater engagement. 

**OverallHealth_Score** 'GenHlth', 'MenHlth''PhysHlth'DiffWalk

Combine four individual health indictors and provide an aggegate of the individuals health. The score provides a comprehensive summary of an individualâ€™s overall health, categorized on a scale of 1 to 4, where **higher scores** indicate **poorer health** and lower scores represent better health.

### ***Target variable Description***: 

- Both Diabetes and Pre-Diabetes are grouped into one category (Diabetes_status) indicating blood glucose conditions, with Non-Diabetes as the second category.
- Early Detection Focus: This grouping  useful for  flagging  anyone at risk of diabetes, including those in the pre-diabetic stage.
- Preventive Action: This approach supports early intervention because it treats both diabetic and pre-diabetic as high-risk groups, prompting similar preventive measures.

![png](output_110_0.png)
    

## Analysis
Feature Importance Order: Comorbid_rating, OverallHealth_Score, and BMI are the top contributors to the model's predictions

Feature Contributions:

The horizontal position (SHAP value) indicates whether the feature increases or decreases the model prediction .
Positive SHAP values push predictions higher risk of diabetes staus, while negative SHAP values push predictions lower . The colors indicate the magnitude of the prediction red indicates a high feature value while blue a low feature value. 

**High importance features**
- ***Comorbid_rating***:High values (red) tend to increase the prediction (positive SHAP values) while low comorbid_rating (blue) tend to decrease the prediction (negative SHAP values).
- **OverallHealth_Score***:High health scores (red) are associated with higher predictions of diabetes status.
Low health scores (blue) reduce predictions.
- **BMI**: High BMI (red) generally increases predictions, while low BMI (blue) reduces predictions.

**Moderate importance Features**
HighBP and Income has mixed SHAP distributions showing that these features have variable effects on predictions depending on their values. For example at lower incomes (red)increases predictions.

**Lower Importance Features**:
Lifestyle_score, Health_AccessEngagement_Score, and HeartDiseaseorAttack have smaller average SHAP values, indicating less overall contribution to the model predictions.


## Examine Feature Interactions

Feature Interaction: Use SHAP dependence plots to explore interactions between **high importance** features 

![png](output_113_0.png)
    
**BMI**
- There is  a non-linear and feature-interactive relationship between BMI and the model's predictions. 
-  BMI has a positive contribution up to a certain threshold but declines thereafter
Feature Interaction 
-  BMI interacts with the comorbid feature to influence predictions. 
    - High BMI combined with high glucose levels (pink) may contribute negatively to the outcome (e.g., risk of diabetes).
    - Low BMI combined with low glucose levels (blue) may contribute positively to a favorable outcome.
- The interaction between BMI and the comorbid feature appears non-linear, with significant effects in the extremes of both features.
- BMI may not always serve as a protection feature and can be overridden by high cormorbid elements.

    
![png](output_116_0.png)
    
**OverallHealth_Score**
- Increasing OverallHealth_Score (positive SHAP values),  pushes the modelâ€™s predictions toward diabetic status (or higher risk).
- Low OverallHealth_Score Indicates better health conditions(lower scores negative SHAP values)  pushes predictions toward non-diabetes (or lower risk).
Feature Interactions:
- non-linear relationship  with the effect of poor health intensifying at higher scores.
- High comorbid feature values (pink) amplify risk at poorer health levels, while low comorbid feature values (blue) mitigate it
- The color gradient  suggest that the impact of poor health is influenced  by additional health or demographic factors.
- Taliored intervention strategies for individuals with poor overall health but low levels of a specific comorbid condition (blue points) 

![png](output_119_0.png)
    
**Comorbid_rating**

- The SHAP values for Comorbid_rating  increase as the comorbid rating itself increases indicating a strong positive contribution to the predictions of diabetic status. 
Feature Interactions:
- A high Comorbid_rating combined with a low interacting feature (blue)seems to  moderate SHAP values, as the protective effect of the interacting feature offsets the severity of comorbidities.
-  high Comorbid_rating combined with a high interacting feature (pink) produces the strongest SHAP values, indicating maximum contribution to risk.

# Use SHAP dependence plots to explore interactions between **moderate  importance** features
moderate_features = ['HighBP', 'Income', 'HighChol']

![png](output_121_1.png)
    
![png](output_121_2.png)
    

# Moderate Importance 
**HighBP**
- HighBP increases predictions, indicating its role as a risk factor for diabetes while the absennce of HighBp decreases predictions, showing it as a protective factor.
- The impact of HighBP is moderated by interactions with other features such as comorbid features
**Income**
- At higher incomes diabetic status predictions are lower and income serves as a protection factor. However lower income increases predictions and serves as a  risk factors for diabetes,
- At lower income levels the variability in SHAP values suggests that income interacts with another features  such as OverallHealth_Score amplifing the effect of low income on predictions.
**HighChol**
- The presence of high cholesterol Increases the likelihood of diabetes, contributing positively to predictions while the absence of HighChol reduces the likelihood of diabetes, contributing negatively to predictions.
- The effect of high cholesterol is moderated or amplified by another features. 


# Use SHAP dependence plots to explore interactions between **low  importance** features
low_features = ['Sex', 'MentHlth', 'Education','Healthy_Eating_Score','Lifestyle_score','Health_AccessEngagement_Score', 'HeartDiseaseorAttack']

![png](output_123_2.png)
    



# Low importance Features 
**SeX**
- For females SHAP values are negative or closer to zero, indicating that being female decreases model's predicted risk.
- For males, SHAP values are positive, indicating that being male increases the predicted risk.
- Feature Interaction: The presence of both blue and pink points indicates a secondary feature has minimal modulation on the influence of Sex.

**MentHlth**
- As MentHlth increases (worse mental health), SHAP values become more negative, reduced risk for predictions.
- Interaction:Blue  dominates at lower MentHlth values while Pink appears more often at higher MentHlth values, and maybe amplifying the effect.

**Education**
- Lower Education levels correspond to higher positive SHAP values, and contributes to increased risk.
- Higher Education levels reduces SHAP values, suggesting a protective effect.
- Interaction:Blue dominates at higher Education levels, reinforcing the protective effect while Pink is more visible at lower Education levels, indicating  a stronger negative impact when education is low and the interacting feature is high.

**Healthy_Eating_Score**
- Lower Healthy_Eating_Score (SHAP values are higher) indicates poor eating habits suggesting poor eating habits increase risk.
- Higher Healthy_Eating_Score (lower SHAP values)indicating a reduced risk.
- Interaction: Blue points dominate at score = 1, reinforcing its protective nature while Pink is more evident at lower scores, amplifying the negative impact of unhealthy eating.

**Lifestyle_score**
- Higher Lifestyle_score (indicating a more detrimental lifestyle) corresponds to more negative SHAP values, indicating an increased negative effect on the prediction.
- Interaction:Blue points dominate at lower Lifestyle_score levels, suggesting a weaker influence.However, pink points become prominent at higher scores, suggesting  increase impact when combined with high values of the interacting feature.

**Health_AccessEngagement_Score**
- Lower scores means poor access/engagement with healthcare and correspond to more negative SHAP values,and increased contribution to risk.
- Higher scores have minimal SHAP contributions, suggesting better healthcare access is less predictive.
 - Interaction:Blue dominates at higher scores,  less predictive .Pink becomes more evident at lower scores, amplifying the feature's negative impact.

#  Key Findings from SHAP Analysis

## **Feature Importance Order**
- High Importance: Comorbid_rating, OverallHealth_Score, and BMI are the top contributors to predictions.
- Moderate Importance: HighBP and Income have variable effects based on feature values.
- Lower Importance: Lifestyle_score, Health_AccessEngagement_Score, and HeartDiseaseorAttack contribute less.

## **High Importance Features**

Comorbid_rating
- High values increase risk (positive SHAP values), while low values reduce risk (negative SHAP values).
- Interactions: High Comorbid_rating with high-risk features amplifies risk (pink). Low-risk features (blue) offset severity.

OverallHealth_Score
- High scores indicate worse health and increase risk, while low scores reduce risk.
- Interactions: High comorbid values (pink) increase risk. Low comorbid values (blue) mitigate risk.

BMI
- High BMI increases predictions, while low BMI reduces risk.
- Interactions: Non-linear; risk increases up to a threshold and declines. High BMI with high glucose amplifies risk (pink), while low BMI with low glucose reduces risk (blue).

## **Moderate Importance Features**

HighBP
- Presence increases risk, absence reduces it.
- Interactions: Risk is moderated by comorbid features.

Income
- Higher income reduces risk, while lower income increases it.
- Interactions: Low income amplifies risk when combined with poor health.

HighChol
- Presence increases risk; absence reduces it.

### **Lower Importance Features**

Sex
- Females have reduced risk (negative SHAP values). Males have increased risk (positive SHAP values).

MentHlth
- Poor mental health reduces risk (negative SHAP values).Interactions: Higher mental health issues amplify effects.

Education
- Lower education increases risk: higher education reduces it. 
- Interactions: Low education with high-risk features amplifies risk .

Healthy_Eating_Score
- Poor eating habits increase risk; healthy eating reduces risk.
- Interactions: Poor eating habits amplify risk, while healthy habits are protective .

Lifestyle_score
- Poor lifestyles increase risk; better lifestyles reduce it.
- Interactions: Poor lifestyle combined with high-risk features  amplifies risk.

Health_AccessEngagement_Score
- Poor healthcare access increases risk: better access has minimal impact.
- Interactions: Poor access with high-risk features (pink) amplifies risk.

## Recommended Interventions

Based on the above analysis the following predictive recommendations are proposed:

1.	Target High-Risk Groups: Focus on individuals with high Comorbid_rating, poor health, low income, and unhealthy lifestyles.
2.	Leverage Protective Factors: Promote healthy eating, higher education, better healthcare access, and income growth.
3.	Address Interactions: Target scenarios where multiple high-risk features compound effects to implement tailored interventions.

# Next Steps 

1.	Validate Findings:
- Conduct robustness checks by applying SHAP analysis to new datasets to ensure the consistency of insights.
- Compare the SHAP feature importance rankings with other feature importance metrics like permutation importance
- Perform subgroup analysis to examine feature contributions across different demographic groups.

2.	Feature Engineering:
- Explore additional composite variables to capture nuanced relationships.
- Investigate temporal patterns in the CDC health data.

3.	Enhance Model Interpretability:
- To confirm key drivers, compare SHAP results across different models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) 
- Simplify models by pruning low-importance features identified in SHAP analysis.

4.	Cluster-Based Analysis:
- To identify distinct risk profiles group individuals based on feature similarity (e.g., clustering by OverallHealth_Score and Lifestyle_score) . 
- Tailor interventions and predictive models for each cluster.
